# <h1 align="center">Hiüê∏. I'm Jorge</h1>

# About Me
I'm currently studying at Instituto Tecnologico de Veracruz fullfilling the role of Computer Systems Engineer student and I've learned to use programming languages such as C, C++, Python, Java, Lua, Rust and others. I have some knowledge in databases using MySQL, PostgreSQL and ORMs like SQLAlchemy. I got experience developing desktop applications using frameworks like Electron, TKinter and Windows Forms. I've also dabbled into game developing, making small projects in game engines like Unity and Godot. My skill set includes setting up and using Linux-operated hardware, which includes small home servers for Minecraft and storage, as well as personal computers and laptops for use.

I've participated in competitive programming before with classmates of my same university. I've been a member of the committee that organizes events related to competitive programming in our university quarters.
